### For detailed results, please check the articleThe purpose of this project, to provide an analysis of individual mobility with respect to socioeconomic factors.



Trip generation is a procedure that uses socioeconomic data (e.g., household size, income, etc.) to estimate the number of person trips for a modeled time period (e.g., daily, peak hour) at a Traffic Analysis Zone (TAZ) level. A person trip involves a single person leaving from an origin and arriving at a single destination, and each trip has a classification/purpose based on typical classification such as home-based-work (HBW), home-based-other (HBO), and non-home-based (NHB).
